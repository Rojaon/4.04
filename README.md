-Did you use the same type of route to update patient information as to update an employeeâ€™s department?

No, i used different types.

-Why did you choose the selected strategy?

Each task needs suitable strategy.

-What are the advantages and disadvantages of the strategies you chose for creating these routes?

PATCH allows you to update only the fields that have changed in the resource, which can be more efficient than updating the entire resource with PUT and vice versa.

-What is the cost-benefit between using PUT and PATCH?

PUT fully updates the resource, while PATCH updates it partially, so the efficiency is depending on your needs.
